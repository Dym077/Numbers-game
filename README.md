## Design

### Imagery
- The game is very sparse on images. It has a few smaller pictures, though - one being the custom logotype and a favicon as well. The limited use of images in the game provides for maximum accessibility as the user will easily understand how to play the game. 


### Colour Scheme
- The colours for this game is based on the sleeve design of Kraftwerk's classic record "Computer World". Dominating values are of course yellow and grey, but there are also values of green, red and orange. The main goal with the choice of colours was to hint at the record and more specifically the songs "Numbers" and "Pocket Calculator". These colours, combined with the font, should provide a retro feel to the game as well. 


### Fonts
- For this game I chose the font "silkscreen", a Google font which was designed by Jason Kottke. This font has a very retro-styled character to it, which brings to mind old computer games from the 80's. 

### Layout

### Wireframes
- All wireframes were made with pen and paper.
