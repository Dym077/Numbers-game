 ## User Feedback

## Design

### Imagery
- The game is very sparse on images. It has a few smaller pictures, though - one being the custom logotype and a favicon as well. The limited use of images in the game provides for maximum accessibility as the user will easily understand how to play the game. 


### Colour Scheme
- The colours for this game is based on the sleeve design of Kraftwerk's classic record "Computer World". Dominating values are of course yellow and grey, but there are also values of green, red and orange. The main goal with the choice of colours was to hint at the record and more specifically the songs "Numbers" and "Pocket Calculator". These colours, combined with the font, should provide a retro feel to the game as well. 


### Fonts
- For this game I chose the font "silkscreen", a Google font which was designed by Jason Kottke. This font has a very retro-styled character to it, which brings to mind old computer games from the 80's. 

### Layout

### Wireframes
- All wireframes were made with pen and paper.

## Features

### Landing Page

The landing page consists of a heading, a game section and a score section. The heading displays the name of the game as well as a logo. 

### Game Section

In the game section there are four buttons which gives the user the opportunity to choose between the four calculation methods. Below the buttons you find the randomly generated numbers together with the calculation method of choice. To the right you find the answer-box in which you can type the answer. The player can dial in the answer either with the keyboard or by using the arrows in the answer-box. To submit the answer the player can either click the "submit"button or hit "enter" on the keyboard. A popup-box will appear on the screen, displaying feedback to the user. If the answer is correct, the popup-box will say "You submitted the correct answer!". If the answer is wrong, the popup-box will tell the player the value of the answer and what the real answer is. For example if the player inaccurately submits the answer "31" to the numbers 16 + 16, the popup-box will say "Your answer is 31. The correct answer should be 32!" To contiue playing, the player can either click "OK" or hit "enter" and another challenge will appear. When the player wants to change calculation method, it's easily done by clicking another of the four buttons displaying the methods. The player is free to play as long as desired, as the game continuosly generates new numbers to calculate. 

#### Score section
In this section, the player can keep score of the progress of the game. The section consists of two areas - the "Correct"-area and the "Incorrect"-area. Every time the player submits a correct answer, the value in the "Correct"-area increases by "1". Every time the player submits an incorrect answer, the value in the "Incrrect"-area increases by "1". The values in the "Correct"-area has a green colour and the values in the "Incorrect"-area has a red colour.

### Features Left to Implement
-A popup window instead of an alert box.
